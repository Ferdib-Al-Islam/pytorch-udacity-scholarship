## Tom Hale's PyTorch Udacity / Facebook scholarship course notes

These notes were written in Markdown with <img src="/tex/7f7cce93036d60ae895df4c900d3fd81.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=54.328533599999986pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> formulae.

The formulae are converted to images by [TeXify](https://github.com/apps/texify).

I believe that I have attributed all materials, except the Udacity PyTorch Scholarship course, which these notes are blatantly copied from ;)
